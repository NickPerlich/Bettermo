["SI Units and Statics  11\nIf the forces acting on the body have the same line of action then the moment becomes zero. The \ntorque is maximum when the forces are at right angles to the arm i.e.) =90o.\nDetermination of mass of the given body using principle of moments.\nADO B Cd2 d1\nm1 m2\nA meter scale AB is supported on a knife edge at its centre such that it remains in equilibrium state. \nLet O be the centre of the scale. On the right side suspend the weight hanger of mass m1 and on the left \nside suspend the given body m2 whose mass is to be calculated. Adjust the positions of m1 and m2    until \nthe scale comes to the exact equilibrium position. Let d1  (OC) and d2  (OD) be the distances of m1 and \nm2.\nAccording to the principle of moments \nm2  d2  = m1  d1\nThe mass of the given body m2 = (m1  d1 ) / d2\nBy changing the values of m1, the experiment is repeated and the readings are tabulated.\nSl.No m1\nkgd1\nmd2\nmm2    = (m1  d1) / d2\nkg\n       Mean  =\nThe average value of the last column gives the mass of the body.\nWORKED EXAMPLES\nFind the magnitude and direction of the two forces 20N and 25N acting at an angle 60o to each 1. \nother.\nGiven:\n  P = 20N  Q = 25N  q = 60o\n   Resultant R =  22P Q 2PQcos++ \n     =   2220 25 2 20 25cos60+ + \n     =  1525\n   R = 39.05N\nDirection  = tan-1  (Q sin )\n(P Qcos ) \n+\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  = tan-1  0\n025 sin 60\n20 25 cos 60 \n+\n            = tan -1  (0.6661)\n           = 33o40'12    Engineering Physics-I\nFind the magnitude and direction of the resultant of two forces 30N and 40N acting at right 2. \nangles to each other.\nGiven\n   P = 30N\n   Q = 40N q = 90\nResultant R =  22P Q 2PQcos++ \n  = 2230 40 2 30 40 cos 90+ +  \n  =   2500\n  R = 50N\n Direction  = tan -1  (40 sin 90)\n(30 40 cos 90) \n+ \n        =  tan -1 (1.333)\n       = 53o7'\nIf the resultant of two equal force is 3. 3times a single force, find the angle between the  \nforces.\nGiven\nTwo forces are equal\n  P = Q = P\n  R = 3  P\n  R2 = P2+Q2+2PQcos\n          (3P)2 = P2+P2+2.P.P.cos\n     3P2- 2P2 = 2P2cos\n  P2 = 2P2cos \n          cos = 12\n             = 60o\nAngle between the forces is 60o\nIf the resultant of two equal forces inclined to each other at 60o  is 84. 3 N, find the component \nforces.\nGiven \n  Two forces are equal. \n  P =  Q = P\n   R =  8 3   N\n   =  60o\n            R2 = P2+Q2+2PQcos\n   (8 3)2  = P2+P2+2.P.Pcos60o\n          192 = 2P2+2P2.12\n          192 = 3P2\n            64 = P2\n  P = 8N\nComponent force is 8N"]
