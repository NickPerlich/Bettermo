## Project Description
The project will be a web-application for organizing shared expenses between groups of people like roommates.
There will be individual logins (maybe with Google OAuth?), and groups of people in the database.
People will be able to post expenses with descriptions, which will update individuals' live balances.
People will also be able to 'pay off balance,' which will show them who they owe money to, and what amount they owe.
