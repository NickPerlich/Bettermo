1.) As a financially conscious college student, I want to be able to ensure that my roommates will be aware of how much they owe me when I grab groceries for them so that I have an accurate representation of how much money I own in my bank account.

2.) As a parent with 4 kids, I want my kids to learn financial responsibility. Having the ability for my kids to offer money to each other in exchange for things between each other could teach them the value of money, services, and things (like toys). (I don't actually condone this behavior)

3.) Exception: Accidental Money Transfer
    If a user accidentally types in an extra 0 into a money charge, the user and go and edit the most recent charge to fix the charge that was given to the group.
