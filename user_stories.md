## User Stories:

1. As a financially conscious college student, I want to be able to ensure that my roommates will be aware of how much they owe me when I grab groceries for them so that I have an accurate representation of how much money I own in my bank account.
2. As a parent with 4 kids, I want my kids to learn financial responsibility. Having the ability for my kids to offer money to each other in exchange for things between each other could teach them the value of money, services, and things (like toys). (I don't actually condone this behavior)
3. As a partner in a 3-person raid team, I want to keep track of when I buy potions for the team so that I can easily be repaid.
4. As a manager of a McDonalds, I want my employees to document business expenses like private jets so that I can have more tax write-offs.
5. As a 112-year-old airbender, I want to keep track of my usage of the 7 chakras so that I can be sure I have no earthly attatchments.
6. As a person with roommates, sometimes I will buy something for the room. I want to be able to easily notify my roommates exactly how much they owe me.
7. As a user, I want to be able to view and settle my outstanding balances with my group members to ensure that financial obligations are clear and up-to-date.
8. As a group admin or a group member, I want the ability to manage group settings and invite new members to the group.


## Exceptions:

1. Accidental Money Transfer: If a user accidentally types in an extra 0 into a money charge, the user can go and edit the most recent charge to fix the charge that was given to the group.
2. Unnecessary transactions: If two users owe each other money, there is no need for them both to send money to the other. The service will determine which of the two owes the other money, and how much they owe after deducting the proper balances.
5. An exception can be raised when there is an issue with creating a new expense. It can encompass various scenarios, such as missing information or a failure to update balances.
6. An exception can be raised when a user attempts to access a group that doesn't exist or is not a member of.
